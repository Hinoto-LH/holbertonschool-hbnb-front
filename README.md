## Part 1: Technical Documentation ##

### Context and Objective ###

In this initial phase, you will focus on creating comprehensive technical documentation that will serve as the foundation for the development of the HBnB Evolution application. This documentation will help in understanding the overall architecture, the detailed design of the business logic, and the interactions within the system.
Problem Description

You are tasked with documenting the architecture and design of a simplified version of an AirBnB-like application, named HBnB Evolution. The application will allow users to perform the following primary operations:

    User Management: Users can register, update their profiles, and be identified as either regular users or administrators.
    Place Management: Users can list properties (places) they own, specifying details such as name, description, price, and location (latitude and longitude). Each place can also have a list of amenities.
    Review Management: Users can leave reviews for places they have visited, including a rating and a comment.
    Amenity Management: The application will manage amenities that can be associated with places.

Business Rules and Requirements

    User Entity

    Each user has a first name, last name, email, and password.
    Users can be identified as administrators through a boolean attribute.
    Users should be able to register, update their profile information, and be deleted.

    Place Entity

    Each place has a title, description, price, latitude, and longitude.
    Places are associated with the user who created them (owner).
    Places can have a list of amenities.
    Places can be created, updated, deleted, and listed.

    Review Entity

    Each review is associated with a specific place and user, and includes a rating and comment.
    Reviews can be created, updated, deleted, and listed by place.

    Amenity Entity

    Each amenity has a name, and description.
    Amenities can be created, updated, deleted, and listed.

        Each object should be uniquely identified by a ID.
        For audit reasons, the creation and update datetime should be registered for all entities.

Architecture and Layers

    The application follows a layered architecture divided into:
        Presentation Layer: This includes the services and API through which users interact with the system.
        Business Logic Layer: This contains the models and the core logic of the application.
        Persistence Layer: This is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database.

Persistence

    All data will be persisted in a database, which will be specified and implemented in Part 3 of the project.

0. High-Level Package Diagram

   <img width="592" height="839" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2195d607-5b3e-4d38-99e3-9839d49afab2" />

Objective

Create a high-level package diagram that illustrates the three-layer architecture of the HBnB application and the communication between these layers via the facade pattern. This diagram will provide a conceptual overview of how the different components of the application are organized and how they interact with each other.
Description

In this task, you will develop a package diagram that visually represents the structure of the application, focusing on its three main layers:

    Presentation Layer (Services, API): This layer handles the interaction between the user and the application. It includes all the services and APIs that are exposed to the users.

    Business Logic Layer (Models): This layer contains the core business logic and the models that represent the entities in the system (e.g., User, Place, Review, Amenity).

    Persistence Layer: This layer is responsible for data storage and retrieval, interacting directly with the database.

Your diagram should clearly show the three layers, the components within each layer, and the communication pathways between them. The facade pattern should be represented as the interface through which the layers interact.
Steps to Complete the Task

    Understand the Layered Architecture

    Review the concept of layered architecture and how it is used to organize an application.
    Understand the responsibilities of each layer in the context of the HBnB application.

    Research the Facade Pattern

    Familiarize yourself with the facade design pattern and how it simplifies interactions between layers by providing a unified interface.

    Identify Key Components

    Identify the key components that belong to each layer:
        Presentation Layer: Services, API endpoints.
        Business Logic Layer: Core models (User, Place, Review, Amenity).
        Persistence Layer: Database access objects or repositories.

    Draft the Package Diagram

    Create a draft of your package diagram, showing the three layers and their components.
    Indicate the communication pathways between layers via the facade pattern.
    Ensure that the diagram is clear, logical, and easy to understand.

    Review and Refine

    Review your diagram to ensure that it accurately represents the application's architecture.
    Make any necessary adjustments to improve clarity and completeness.
